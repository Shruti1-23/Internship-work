     <p><strong>HOW TO MAKE PANCAKE</strong>
          <h2>Ingredients (serves 4)</h2>


    200g plain flour
    2 large eggs
    400ml milk
    1 tsp vegetable oil
    Utensils



Large frying pan
Whisk
Large bowl
Thin spatula
Prep (less than 30 minutes)

Put the plain flour in a bowl, before using your (clean) fingers to make a well at its centre
Crack the eggs into a saucer and pour into the well
Add 400ml of milk into the well
Beat the mixture with a hand mixer, working to incorporate all the flour until you have a smooth batter
Cooking (less than 10 minutes)

Put a large frying pan on the hob on a medium heat
Drizzle vegetable oil and swirl it around until it is hot and the pan evenly coated
Spoon 2 tbsp of pancake batter in the centre of the pan and swirl around until the base is coated in a thin layer of batter (depending on the size of your pan – you may need to vary the amount of mixture)
Cook for approximately one minute on each side, flipping them with the spatula – or toss them if you’re feeling brave</p>
